## DAY 12 – MLflow Model Training & Experiment Tracking (Databricks)

---

### Learn

- Introduction to MLflow and experiment tracking
- Training machine learning models in Databricks
- Logging parameters, metrics, and artifacts using MLflow
- Managing multiple experiment runs
- Understanding model performance through tracked metrics

---

### 🛠️ Tasks

1. Trained a machine learning model using Databricks
2. Created an MLflow experiment
3. Logged model parameters and evaluation metrics
4. Tracked multiple experiment runs
5. Reviewed experiment results using MLflow UI

---

### 📝 Practice

- Implemented model training code with MLflow integration
- Logged parameters such as learning rate and model settings
- Recorded evaluation metrics like accuracy and loss
- Stored trained model as an MLflow artifact
- Compared different runs to analyze model performance
- Used MLflow experiment UI to monitor and manage runs
